# Task 03 â€“ Password Complexity Checker

Cybersecurity Internship â€“ Prodigy InfoTech

### ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains my implementation of a Password Complexity Checker, a Python program that evaluates the strength of a password based on multiple security criteria. It helps users identify weak passwords and encourages the creation of strong, secure ones.

This project was developed as part of my Cybersecurity internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

### ðŸ›  Features

**Length Check** â€“ Ensures the password meets the minimum length requirement.

**Uppercase & Lowercase Check** â€“ Detects the presence of both uppercase and lowercase characters.

**Digit Check** â€“ Validates that at least one numeric digit is included.

**Special Character Check** â€“ Requires special characters for added complexity.

**Common Password Detection** â€“ Blocks passwords found in the most common password lists.

**Scoring System** â€“ Rates password strength as Too Weak, Weak, Medium, or Strong.
